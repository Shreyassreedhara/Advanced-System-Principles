2. Inter-process communication mechanisms
3. Pthreads Library
4. Solving classical IPC problems using Pthreads
5. Virtual Memory Management
6. Mapping Memory
7. File system management 
8. Introduction to device drivers
9. Char drivers
10. Memory mapping and DMA
11. I/O Mechanisms 
12. Concurrency and race conditions
13. USB device drivers
14. Testing a USB keyboard driver
